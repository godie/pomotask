# 🤖 AGENT.md — Instructions for AI Agents

> Read this file FIRST before doing anything else in this repo.

## What is this project?

**Pomotask** — A todo list app where everything is measured in Pomodoros.
Users manage projects and tasks, run a Pomodoro timer, and track estimated vs real Pomodoros per task and project.

---

## Your workflow

1. **Read docs in order**:
   - `README.md` — project overview and stack
   - `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md` — what to build (and what NOT to build)
   - `docs/SPECS.md` — technical decisions, types, architecture
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` — your task list, phase by phase

2. **Design tokens**: Before writing ANY component, connect to Stitch MCP:
   - URL: `https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/6328229122179225454`
   - Get: colors, typography, spacing, component designs
   - Apply them via Tailwind CSS variables

3. **Work phase by phase** in `ROADMAP.md`. Mark tasks `[x]` as you complete them.

4. **Every task follows TDD — Red → Green → Refactor** (see section below).

5. **Commit after each phase** using conventional commits.

6. **Never skip phases** — each phase depends on the previous one.

## 🔴🟢♻️ TDD Workflow — MANDATORY

**You must never write implementation code before writing a failing test.**
This is non-negotiable. Every piece of logic, every function, every hook, every component follows this exact cycle:

### The cycle for EVERY task

```
🔴 RED     → Write the test first. Run it. It MUST fail.
              If it passes without implementation → the test is wrong. Fix it.

🟢 GREEN   → Write the minimum code to make the test pass.
              No extra logic. No polish. Just enough to go green.

♻️ REFACTOR → Clean up the code. Improve names, extract helpers, remove duplication.
              Run tests again. They must still be green after refactoring.
```

### TDD rules you must follow

- **One test at a time.** Write one test → make it pass → write the next.
- **Tests live in `src/tests/`** mirroring the source structure:
  - `src/lib/pomodoro.ts` → `src/tests/lib/pomodoro.test.ts`
  - `src/db/tasks.ts` → `src/tests/db/tasks.test.ts`
  - `src/stores/timerStore.ts` → `src/tests/stores/timerStore.test.ts`
  - `src/components/timer/TimerRing.tsx` → `src/tests/components/timer/TimerRing.test.tsx`
- **Run tests after every change**: `pnpm test:run`
- **Never commit red tests.** All tests must be green before committing.
- **Test names must describe behavior**, not implementation:
  - ✅ `'increments real pomodoros when focus session completes'`
  - ❌ `'calls incrementRealPomodoros function'`

### What to test per layer

| Layer                       | What to test                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/` (business logic) | All functions, all edge cases, all business rules                     |
| `src/db/` (data layer)      | CRUD operations (mock Dexie — already set up in `src/tests/setup.ts`) |
| `src/stores/` (Zustand)     | State transitions, actions, side effects                              |
| `src/hooks/` (Query hooks)  | Hook behavior with mocked query client                                |
| `src/components/` (UI)      | Render output, user interactions, conditional display                 |

### Minimum test coverage per task

Before marking any ROADMAP task `[x]`, it must have:

- At least **one test per exported function or component**
- Tests covering the **happy path** and at least **one edge case or error case**
- `pnpm test:run` passing with **no failures**

### Example TDD cycle — `shouldSplitTask`

```typescript
// 🔴 Step 1 — Write test FIRST (file doesn't exist yet)
it("returns true when estimate is greater than 5", () => {
  expect(shouldSplitTask(6)).toBe(true); // ← FAILS (no implementation)
});

// Run: pnpm test:run → RED ✓

// 🟢 Step 2 — Write minimum implementation
export function shouldSplitTask(n: number): boolean {
  return n > 5;
}

// Run: pnpm test:run → GREEN ✓

// ♻️ Step 3 — Refactor if needed, run tests again → still GREEN ✓
```

### TDD for UI components

For React components, test behavior not markup:

```typescript
// 🔴 Write test first
it('shows break overlay when timer is in break mode', () => {
  render(<BreakOverlay mode="short_break" secondsLeft={300} />)
  expect(screen.getByText(/short break/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// 🟢 Then create BreakOverlay.tsx with minimum JSX to pass
// ♻️ Then refactor styles, extract subcomponents, etc.
```

## Key rules

- **TDD is mandatory** — test first, always, no exceptions
- **NO TYPE `any` ALLOWED** — The linter is configured to block it as an error. Use:
  - Explicit types (e.g., `string`, `number`, `MyInterface`)
  - `unknown` for truly unknown values
  - Generics (e.g., `Array<T>`, `Promise<Response>`)
  - Compiler-inferred types when appropriate
  - ❌ **NEVER** use `any` — it will fail CI
- Do not add features not listed in `MVP_SCOPE.md`
- Do not use any library not listed in `SPECS.md` without noting it
- All data must persist in IndexedDB (Dexie) — this is offline-first
- Auth is optional — the app must work 100% without it
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Never commit failing tests

## Where things live

| What           | Where                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Types          | `src/types/index.ts`       |
| DB operations  | `src/db/`                  |
| Timer logic    | `src/stores/timerStore.ts` |
| Business rules | `src/lib/pomodoro.ts`      |
| Query hooks    | `src/hooks/`               |
| Routes/Pages   | `src/routes/`              |
| Components     | `src/components/`          |

---

## Business rules to never break

- A Pomodoro = 25 min focus
- After 4 Pomodoros → long break (15 min), else short break (5 min)
- If task estimate > 5 Pomodoros → must offer to split into 2 tasks
- Split divides estimate evenly (`Math.ceil` for part 1)
- `realPomodoros` is auto-incremented only — never manually editable by user
- Tasks can belong to a project or be standalone (no project)

---

## Pre-commit and CI checks — mandatory

Every commit must pass these checks locally before pushing. CI will enforce the same checks.

### Local pre-commit checks

The husky pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) runs:

1. **lint-staged** — runs ESLint and TypeScript check on staged `.ts`/`.tsx` files only
2. **vitest run --coverage** — runs all tests

### lint-staged configuration

The current setup (`lint-staged.config.mjs`):

```javascript
export default {
  "*.{ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --max-warnings 0 --fix --no-warn-ignored",
    "bash -c 'tsc --noEmit'",
  ],
  "*.{json,md,yml,yaml}": ["prettier --write"],
};
```

This means:

- For `.ts`/`.tsx` files: ESLint (with fixes) + TypeScript check
- For `.json`/`.md`/`.yml`/`.yaml`: Prettier formatting

### Running checks manually

If you need to run checks manually:

```bash
# lint-staged (staged files only)
pnpm exec lint-staged

# Full lint (all files)
pnpm lint

# TypeScript check (all files)
pnpm typecheck

# Tests
pnpm test:run
```

### Rule

**If any of these commands fail, do not commit.** Fix the issues first. CI will block merges that fail these checks.

## Convex integration — REQUIRED reading

Read this before touching anything related to Convex. Follow these rules exactly.

### Where Convex lives

- **Convex backend** lives in `convex/` at repo root.
- **Generated client** lives in `convex/_generated/`. Do not modify or move files inside `_generated/`.
- Frontend imports the generated client from `../../convex/_generated/api`.
- Use `pnpm` for all installs and `npx convex` commands from repo root.

### Commands agents may run

- `pnpm add convex` — only if adding the dependency is required.
- `npx convex dev` — run local Convex dev server.
- `npx convex codegen` — after any change to `convex/schema.ts`.

### What agents must NOT do

- Do not modify files in `convex/_generated/`.
- Do not move the UI out of `src/`.
- Do not implement Convex Auth in this phase. `convex/auth.config.ts` exists but is empty.
- Do not create CLI inside this repo. CLI lives in a separate repo.

### Files in `convex/`

- `schema.ts` — database schema
- `auth.config.ts` — auth configuration (empty for now)
- `crons.ts` — scheduled tasks
- `tasks.ts` — task mutations/queries
- `agents.ts` — agent management
- `logs.ts` — logging
- `comments.ts` — comments
- `watchdog.ts` — watchdog for monitoring
- `_generated/` — do not touch

### Context and task definitions for Convex

- `convex-contexto.md` — Convex context
- `convex-tareas.md` — Task list for Convex
